    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Knitted fabrics have a variety of end-uses, such as dress wear, bed linen, upholstery, carpets, etc. Knitting has developed into an important method of fabric manufacture and competes with woven fabrics for new shares in the market. 
        Woven fabric is made by interlacing two sets of yarns, warp and weft, whereas knitted fabrics are formed by interconnecting loops from a single set of yarns. Depending on whether the yarn used for loop formation is lying length-wise or cross-wise, fabrics can be distinguished between warp (length-wise) and weft (cross-wise) knitted fabrics.

    <h2>1.1 Definitions and Terminology</h2>

    <h3>What is Knitting?</h3>
    <p>Knitting is a method used to produce textile structures by interlooping yarns. Different types of needles are employed to form loops. The process of making loops from yarns is shown in the figure below.</p>

    <h3>Weft Knitting</h3>
    <p>
        Weft knitting is the method of fabric formation by interlocking yarns lying in the weft direction. A large number of knitting needles are used to form loops from a horizontal thread and link them with loops from a second thread, as shown in the figure.

    <h2>1.2 Basics of Loop Formation</h2>
    <p>
        In weft knitting, loops are formed and interlocked by hooked needles (bearded needles). As yarn is laid, sinkers move forward, bending the yarn to form loops. The structural components of these loops are known as the sinker loop and the needle loop. The figure illustrates the entire loop formation process.

    <h2>The Needle</h2>
    <p>
        For the formation of loops, different knitting elements are required. The most important of these is the needle. There are three types of commonly used needles for knitting:

        <li>Latch Needles</li>
        <li>Compound Needles</li>
    </ul>
